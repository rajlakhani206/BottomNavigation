# BottomNavigation
## Android Bottom Navigation App

This is a simple Android app that demonstrates the use of the Bottom Navigation component for navigating between different fragments within the app. It includes four main fragments:

- **MusicFragment**: Displays music-related content.
- **FavFragment**: Allows users to input data and pass it to other fragments.
- **NewsFragment**: Placeholder fragment for displaying news content.
- **PlacesFragment**: Placeholder fragment for displaying places-related content.

The app uses the Navigation Component to manage fragment navigation and communicates between fragments using the `Communicator` interface.

Feel free to explore the code to learn how to implement bottom navigation and fragment communication in your Android app.
